# Employee-Management-Web-Application
In this project, I built a basic Employee Management Application. In the project, the user can manage his
employees with the necessary CRUD operations. MySQL was used as a database to store data in the project. JAVA,
Spring Boot is used in the backend part of the project. Angular, HTML, CSS and TypeScript are used in the UI
section of the project.
